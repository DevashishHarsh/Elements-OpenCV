# Elements - A Magical Experience
I worked on this side project to create something new interactive and visually appealing content for the users. You can use your webcam without any heavy VFX to create these visualizations. It brings joy to just be able to see those powers come to life just like your favourite characters do in movies, shows etc. 

## Power List
- 🔥 Fire Flame : Summon a small flame on the tip of your finger ( literally! ).
- 💧 Water Shield : Summon a water shield by charging with your right fist and then opening your hand to create the shield.
- ⚡ Lightning : Summon thunder between your palms by holding them near to each other.
- 🌪️ Tornado : Summon a tornado by pointing both your index fingers towards an angle ( should be inside the frame ).
- <img src="emote/infinity_gauntlet.png" alt="Infinity Gauntlet" width="40"> Infinity Gauntlet : Become thanos and get all the infinity stones on the back of your hand, and use the iconic snap to erase the existence.
