# Elements - A Magical Experience
I worked on this side project to create something new interactive and visually appealing content for the users. You can use your webcam without any heavy VFX to create these visualizations. It brings joy to just be able to see those powers come to life just like your favourite characters do in movies, shows etc.

- ‚ö° Lightning : Summon thunder between your palms by holding them near to each other.
- üå™Ô∏è Tornado : Summon a tornado by pointing both your index fingers towards an angle ( should be inside the frame ).
